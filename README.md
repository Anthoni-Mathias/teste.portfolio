## PortFolio_Website
 Welcome to my portfolio website. This website was created for my Code Insitute User-Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project. Here's a sneak preview: 
 
 ![my portfolio](https://github.com/Anthoni-Mathias/MILESTONE-PROJECT-1/blob/master/img/readme-img/Am%20I%20Responsive_%20-%20Google%20Chrome%204_19_2021%2012_53_31%20PM%20(2).png)

This static wesbite is designed as an online portfolio that can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. It can be viewed [here](https://anthoni-mathias.github.io/MILESTONE-PROJECT-1/).
It utilises my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills to serve as a landing page for potential clients and employers. It highlights my education and employment history, technical skills, and showcases projects I have created for local groups, small businesses and solo entrepreneurs. Potential clients are able to read client stories reflecting on how the projects I have created for them have had a positive impact and helped their ventures to flourish. After their journey thorugh my page, the end goal is that potential clients are persuaded to get in touch using the contact form so we can explore any potential projects.
