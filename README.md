## PortFolio_Website
 Welcome to my portfolio website. This website was created for my Code Insitute User-Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project. Here's a sneak preview:

This static wesbite is designed as an online portfolio that can be used during and after my time learning and creating with the Code Institute. It can be viewed [here](https://anthoni-mathias.github.io/MILESTONE-PROJECT-1/).
It utilises my HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills to serve as a landing page for potential clients and employers. It highlights my education and employment history, technical skills, and showcases projects I have created for local groups, small businesses and solo entrepreneurs. Potential clients are able to read client stories reflecting on how the projects I have created for them have had a positive impact and helped their ventures to flourish. After their journey thorugh my page, the end goal is that potential clients are persuaded to get in touch using the contact form so we can explore any potential projects.

This website was primarily designed with prospective clients in mind. I envisioned my ideal client to be a small business owner looking for a website tailored to their business needs and ethos. My users needed to experience a website that had a clean, responsive design and showcased a range of skills, but didn't bombard them with effects. They needed to find navigating the site an easy and intuitive experience, and this needed to be true whether they viewed my website on a mobile device, tablet or computer. 

As my prospective clients scrolled through my site, I wanted them to get an overview of myself, my ethos and my employment and education history. I also wanted them to be able to download my CV if they wanted a more formal representation of this. By using project cards, I wanted to show off some of the projects I have done. For potential clients and employers that are more technical, I wanted them to be able to see projects I have created and access my Github profile. By using client stories, I wanted them to get a sense of the impact these projects had on the individuals and businesses they were designed for. 

Finally, at the end of a user's journey through my webpage, I needed them to have a way to contact me so we could chat about any potential projects. In the footer I needed icons that would link the user to my external social media sites, including GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter, while keeping my own webpage visible. At the close here, in case the user had not done so already, I also needed to prompt users with another opportunity to download my CV.
